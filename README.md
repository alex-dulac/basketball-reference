# basketball-reference-project

Java/Spring Boot RESTful application used to scrape data from basketball-reference.

The resource has no API available, so the application scrapes the data directly from the website.

Though, you'll get locked out if you exceed a scrape limit per hour, so it's not intended for use other than just messing around.
